    Hello,
    I'll be coming to Portland around 11.10 and need to secure a furnished room for at least 2 weeks, and month to month preferred thereafter. I'm a huge walker and won't have a car, so I'll need to be near public transportation and a grocery store, restaurants and some cultural activity...no faraway suburbs. Verified Pay Pal, LinkedIn, Facebook and/or Airbnb accounts only and phone/Skype conversations, please.

    I am a 'young', creative woman in my 40's with a background in fashion/art, music, acting/voice acting and clinical skin care therapist is my day job. Have lived in CA for 25 years and many major cities throughout the US as well as Italia. I'm extremely CLEAN, considerate, adaptable and interactive, although I respect privacy and quiet time. Also a huge pet lover/caretaker, particularly of senior rescue dogs, and I have excellent references for this as well from the #1 non profit in the Bay Area, Muttville, and I welcome being around and caring for pets.

    I will be interviewing for jobs and getting to know the city. I also have 30 plus glowing reviews from airbnb as well as from a lovely, family/couple I recently house/cat sat for in Portland in July 2016.

    Thank you ~~~~~
